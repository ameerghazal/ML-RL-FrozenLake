# Machine Learing Reinforcement Learning: Frozen Lake Project

- Proposed Domain: An agent traverses through the 4x4 lake layout without falling into the holes. Winning can be attained by reaching the goal state. There is no guarantee of the agent moving in the intended direction via the slippery ice panels. 
- Hypothesis: RL can discover a method to successfully traverse any randomly generated solvable Frozen Lake maze. 
- Significance: Solving lower scale projects prepares us to solve real-world, applicable solutions. 
- Existing software: Frozen Lake simulator via gymnasium: https://gymnasium.farama.org/environments/toy_text/frozen_lake/
- Proposed Contributions: Ameer and Namil will each implement the different RL algorithms i.e. Q-learning and Dynamic Programming.
